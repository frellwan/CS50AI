Implementation of a Tic Tac Toe AI using a Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. Randomisation varies the AI's moves where several have equal utility.

## Knights

An AI that plays the classic Windows 'Minesweeper' game, using a knowledge base and inference to generate new knowledge about the game state.

## Pagerank
