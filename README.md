Implementation of a Breadth-First Search Algorithm to find the degrees of separation between two selected actors, by films they have starred in.

## Tic Tac Toe

Implementation of a Tic Tac Toe AI using a Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. Randomisation varies the AI's moves where several have equal utility.

## Knights

Solutions to 'Knights and Knaves' style logic puzzles using Propositional Logic and Model Checking.

## Minesweeper
![image](https://github.com/frellwan/CS50AI/assets/12740967/35fcce6c-63e1-44a2-a8ed-563aeedaad38)

An AI that plays the classic Windows 'Minesweeper' game, using a knowledge base and inference to generate new knowledge about the game state.

## Pagerank

An AI that ranks web pages by importance - similar to the Google PageRank AI - using both a Random Surfer Model and an Iterative Algorithm.

## Heredity

An AI that predicts the likelihood of members of a family having a 0, 1, or 2 copies of a gene, and a trait caused by that gene, using a Bayesian Network and Inference by Enumeration.

## Crossword
![image](https://github.com/frellwan/CS50AI/assets/12740967/34437fc1-0201-4bc0-823d-a8de3eef5555)

An AI that generates crossword puzzles, by treating the crossword generation as a constraint satisfaction problem and using a backtracking search algorithm.

## Shopping
![image](https://github.com/frellwan/CS50AI/assets/12740967/3c05ccb1-4f79-4ded-a2c8-9807c82899b3)

An AI that predicts whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase, using the Scikit-Learn k-Nearest Neighbour classifier on a customer dataset.

## Nim

An AI that teaches itself to play the game 'Nim' using Reinforcement Learning. A Q-Learning algorithm with Îµ-Greedy Decision Making is used to estimate the value of actions for game states.

## Traffic
![image](https://github.com/frellwan/CS50AI/assets/12740967/fa920328-ac16-4f0e-b6ce-375780e0cf36)

An AI that identifies which traffic sign appears in a photograph, using a TensorFlow convolutional neural network.

## Parser
![image](https://github.com/frellwan/CS50AI/assets/12740967/ad16a62e-2658-4178-9bab-acfaa038524b)

An AI that can parse sentences and extract noun phrases, using the context-free grammar formalism and the Python nltk library.

# Questions

An AI that answers questions, by determining the most relevant document(s) using tf-idf ranking and then extracting the most relevant sentence(s) using idf and a query term density measure.
